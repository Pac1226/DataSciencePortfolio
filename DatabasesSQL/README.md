## Usage

Jupyter Notebook "etf_analyzer.ipynb" is used to analyze a fintech ETF that consists of four stocks: GOST, GS, PYPL, and SQ. Each stock has its own table in the etf.db database. Visualizations of the ETF and individual stock performance are deployed to a web application by using the Voil√† library.

The application is divided into four parts:

1) Analysis of PayPal asset in the ETF

2) Optimization of data access using Advanced SQL queries

3) Analysis of the ETF portfolio

4) Deployment of the notebook as a web application
