## Problem ##

The ability to make accurate predictions of future revenue is extremely important for eCommerce companies as sales and margins fluctuate throughout the year. This LatAm eCommerce business tends to underperform in Q3 and is looking for insights to optimize marketing spend, product planning, and staffing levels. To combat this problem, we mine financial and user data for seasonality and forecast quarterly revenue and search traffic using Prophet.

## Question ##

What is the near-term sales forecast and is there a relationship between search activity and daily sales?

Time Series Analysis & Forecasting with Prophet

## Insights ##

Revenue ebbs and flows with the academic calendar in South America and tends to lag search activity. Sales are highest when school is in session and often rises after periods of elevated search activity, suggesting that customers research before purchasing. 

The sales forecast for Q3 2020 is $970 million. There is a 95% likelihood that it will fall within a +/- 8% range of this target. Q3 sales peak around Mexican Independence Day and the Feast of Corpus Cristi in Brazil, bookending the quarter with national holidays.

## Action ## 

We recommend three initiatives. First, upsell customers actively searching for products by using targeted promotions and product recommendations to incentivize them to increase their shopping carts. Second, launch heavy sales in June to clear inventory and win back lapsed customers. Third, reallocate some of the Q3 marketing budget to Q4 to maximize impact and put less pressure on margins in Q3.
